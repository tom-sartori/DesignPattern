## Creational patterns

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                               |

| Singleton | Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. |


## SOLID principles

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                        |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single-responsability | There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility. | 
| Open-closed           | Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.                                                   | 
| Liskov substitution   | Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.       | 
| Interface segregation | Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.                                                       | 
| Dependency inversion  | Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.                                                                                       |
